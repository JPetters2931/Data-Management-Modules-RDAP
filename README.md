# Data-Management-Modules-RDAP
This repo will be used during the Friendly Intro to GitHub at RDAP 2017 workshop to collect Data Management Modules. You can follow along with my presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TrFqki9hXt0Aw9YcSACDWdVif2RI237hGkTdypxf3kI/edit?usp=sharing).

Welome to the Small Group Work Session!
Let's collaboratively design a Data Management Course with modules.   

1. **Break into groups of 3-4 people**.
2. **Designate a group coordinator**. This person will fork this repo and coordinate your groups contributions. 
3. **Group coordinator forks the repo** 
- at this point, the coordinator will make group members into collaborators
4. **Group will work together using Issues, and creating new_modules.md documents**
- a list of potential modules is [here](https://github.com/daniellecrobinson/Data-Management-Modules-RDAP/blob/master/Module-Topics.md), but feel free to make up your own.
7. When adding a doccument or making a change, select "Create a new branch for this committ and start a Pull request"

![Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request](/collab-pull-reg-screen-shot.png.png)

5. **Make a new .md document** in the repo and write a description for your module

**Check point** Does each group coordinator have a forked copy of the template file with a new, uniquely named .md file for their module?


8. Merge the forks
9. Resolve the conflics!

**Check point** Does every group have one, uniquely named Your-Module.md file that contains content from each group member?

11. Group Coordinators **make a pull request** back to Danielle's repo. 
12. Watch the magic happen, as all modules are added to the main repo!
