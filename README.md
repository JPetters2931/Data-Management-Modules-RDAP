# Data-Management-Modules-RDAP
This repo will be used during the Friendly Intro to GitHub at RDAP 2017 workshop to collect Data Management Modules

Welome to the Small Group Work Session!
Let's collaboratively design a Data Management Course with modules.   

1. **Break into groups of 3-4 people**.
2. **Designate a group coordinator**. This person will fork my template repo and coordinate your groups contributions. 
3. **Claim a module topic** from [here](https://github.com/daniellecrobinson/Data-Management-Modules-RDAP/blob/master/Module-Topics.md) - your group will map out content for that module. 
4. **Group coordinator forks the repo** 
- at this point, the coordinator can make group members into collaborators
- but we encourgae group members to fork the repo of the group coordinator, add content, and make a pull request.
5. **Make a new .md document** in the repo and write a description for your module

**Check point** Does each group coordinator have a forked copy of the template file with a new, uniquely named .md file for their module?

6. Group members fork the repo of the group coordinator, which will contain the new Your-Module.md document
7. Each member add a section to the Your-Module.md
8. Merge the forks
9. Resolve the conflics!

**Check point** Does every group have one, uniquely named Your-Module.md file that contains content from each group member?

11. Group Coordinators **make a pull request** back to Danielle's repo. 
12. Watch the magic happen, as all modules are added to the main repo!
